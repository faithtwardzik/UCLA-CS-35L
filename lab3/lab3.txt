Lab 3 Log

First, I exported /usr/bin to my path, to make sure the ls being referenced 
was from this directory:
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin

Next, I ran the buggy command on one of my directories:
ls -a -A
This outputted the buggy behavior described in the spec; the hidden files . 
and .. were outputted along with the rest of the directory's contents.

Then, I found the Coreutils version of ls using:
/usr/bin/ls --version
This outputted the Coreutils version 8.22 for /usr/bin/ls. 

1.)
Then, I downloaded the tar ball, as well as the signature and GNU key-ring 
from the linked website:
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig

Then I ran the verification command:
gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig

It outputted the following:
gpg: Signature made Wed 27 Dec 2017 10:29:05 AM PST using RSA key ID 306037D9
gpg: Good signature from "Pádraig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pixelbeat@gnu.org>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 6C37 DC12 121A 5006 BC1D  B804 DF6F D971 3060 37D9
There were no problems with this verification, other than the warning
that its signature may be from an unreliable source.

Then, I made a temporary directory:
mkdir temp_dir

And I untar-ed the files within that temporary directory:
tar -xJvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
mv coreutils-8.29 temp_dir/coreutils-8.29

cd coreutils-8.29

2.)
I ran the following commands to compile and install:
./configure
make
make install

The make install command did not work; it resulted in the error:
make: *** [install] Error 2
As well as about fifty other errors. 

Starting here, I went on a wild goose chase to figure out why I was getting 
these errors (most of which were permission denied errors) and how to get 
'make install' to work. One helpful site suggested moving the coreutils 
package into my usr/bin/ and then adding a path to the coreutils directory 
into my ~/.profile so that it could be found when ./configure was run. This 
did not work. Another suggested adding the --prefix option to ./configure:
./configure --prefix=/u/eng/class/classtwa/bin

This also did not work when I ran make install afterwards. Then I tried 
changing the --prefix absolute path to my temp_dir, to see if anything 
happened. 
./configure --prefix=/u/eng/class/classtwa/Desktop/35L/lab3/temp_dir

However, upon going into temp_dir, there were no files there after configure 
ran. So obviously, make and then make install gave me the same errors. By 
some stroke of luck I found a suggestion to use my last command, and then 
when calling make and make install from inside of coreutils-8.29, do this 
instead:
PREFIX=/u/eng/class/classtwa/Desktop/35L/lab3/temp_dir make
PREFIX=/u/eng/class/classtwa/Desktop/35L/lab3/temp_dir make install

This worked! make install did not return any errors, and the temp_dir had the 
following directories in it: bin, libexec, and share, as we would expect 
from the installation.  

3.) I reproduced the bug using the commands in the patch messages:
cd ..
mkdir foo
cd foo
~/Desktop/35L/lab3/temp_dir/bin/ls -fA

This uses the new coreutils-8.29 version of ls, and outputted:
. ..
Which is the same buggy behavior as it should be empty, because -A should be 
overriding -f. 

4.) I downloaded the patch and transferred it over using FileZilla.

Then, I moved it over to coreutils-8.29 to serve as the working directory:
mv ~/Desktop/35L/lab3/0001-ls-A-now-overrides-a.patch 
~/bin/coreutils-8.29/0001-ls-A-now-overrides-a.patch

Then, I applied the patch:
patch -p1 < 0001-ls-A-now-overrides-a.patch

This outputted a few warnings, but I believe it worked on everything except 
the file "NEWS":
patching file NEWS
Hunk #1 FAILED at 4.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file NEWS.rej
patching file src/ls.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 1900 (offset -3 lines).
patching file tests/local.mk
patching file tests/ls/a-option.sh

5.)
I moved to the top of my source tree:
cd /u

Here, I ran the make file:
(cd eng/class/classtwa/bin/coreutils-8.29 && make)
But this gave me several errors, including:
'WARNING: 'automake-1.15' is missing on your system.'

Piazza suggested a fix, so instead I ran:
(cd eng/class/classtwa/bin/coreutils-8.29 && autoreconf -f -i && make)
And this outputted no errors. 

6.)
I moved to my home directory:
cd ~

Then, I went back to my foo directory and ran the ls command to see if the 
patch worked:
cd ~/Desktop/35L/lab3/foo
~/bin/coreutils-8.29/src/ls -a -A

This worked! It outputted nothing, which is what we wanted!
