Lab 8 Log

1) I first cd'ed into the directory:
cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L
Then, I ran the command:
du -c -sch ./.git
This outputted the following total disk space used for the git repository:
350M
If we run the following command: 
du -c
And scroll to the ./.git directory, the total number of disk space used for
the git repository is actually:
358316

Then, I ran the command:
du -c
This outputted the following total disk space used for all of the files in
the directory:
520828

To get the total number for working files in the directory, we can subtract
the total files - the ./.git files, which gives us:
520828 - 358316 = 162512

I used the following command:
du -a ./.git | sort -n

This outputted a sorted list with the files in ./.git and their disk sizes.
The one with the largest size is:
318152  ./.git/objects/pack/pack-24e56b1749b9320c560213d9045fa6cee42b4174.pack

It makes sense that a pack file such as this would be so large, because 
packfiles include many objects, and objects include commits, trees, blobs,
etc, which altogether take a significant amount of space.  

2) I used the command:
git branch -r | wc -l 
This outputted the number of remote branches, which was 177.

Then, I used the command:
git branch -a | wc -l
This outputted all branches, which was 353.

This means that the number of local branches is all branches - the remote 
branches, which gives us 353 - 177 = 176 local branches.

3) I used the command:
git remote
This gave me one remote repository: origin.

Then, I ran the command:
git remote show origin
This outputted the fetch URL, where the remote repository is:
https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git

4) I ran the following command:
git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate refs/heads/

This will sort the refs based on the last date a commit was made. The most
recent ten branches with commits (with the most recent first) were (in the 
format of the commit hash, then the branch name):

5448c0cce64b7f5277c820dcd3cd839f9388e241 commit refs/heads/other-branches/miles-orphaned-changes
f4c1c47c5b311c19b4cd0c3296783fc83b6c19b9 commit refs/heads/old-branches/branch-5_8
71c9ec5139c8cacdcdcc499a72f3800f1b84000a commit refs/heads/other-branches/gerd_0001
f57c4de274087f802f52587b362acc2cee4c7833 commit refs/heads/other-branches/custom_themes
f1f65349f47be2982fc2dfb3847c730e520703f6 commit refs/heads/other-branches/gerd_int

f0643701da91a91f0c36dc356e00070f38af9ebe commit refs/heads/other-branches/gerd_dbe
2c92b538e6b484cc731fa8d2225ed16459e9848c commit refs/heads/other-branches/fx-branch

5) I ran the following command:
git rev-list master | wc -l

This outputted the number of commits from the master branch, which was:
139583

6) I used the following command:
git log | wc -l 

This outputted the number of total commits, which was:
1240390

Therefore, the ratio of the commits from the master branch to all of the 
commits is: 139583 / 1240390 = 0.1125, which is about 11.25%. 

7) I used the following command:
git log master --after=2013 --format=format:"%an" > ~/Desktop/35L/lab8/testing

This redirected to a file, the list of commits on the master branch after 2013,
with each entry being just the author of the commit's name.

Then, I used the command:
sort testing | uniq --count | sort -nr > testnums

This outputted a sorted list of the authors' names' duplicates, sorted by
the frequency of the count of each author's name. The authors with the top
ten frequencies of commits were (with the number of commits on the left):
   3627 Eli Zaretskii
   3526 Paul Eggert
   3426 Glenn Morris
   1806 Lars Ingebrigtsen
   1725 Stefan Monnier
   1513 Michael Albinus
    611 Dmitry Gutov
    576 Noam Postavsky
    465 Alan Mackenzie
    455 Juri Linkov

8) I used the following command:
git log --merges > ~/Desktop/35L/lab8/q8

This redirected a list of the merge commits to this file. Then, I opened
up the file in Emacs and used C-s to search for the hashes provided on the 
specification page. If there was a match, that meant the commit was a merge
commit. The following came up as matches, and are therefore merge commits:
0c06b93c1e467debd401eb0b3be4652fde14fa95
abcb2e62dae6aa26308f7ac9efc89247f89cbe65
