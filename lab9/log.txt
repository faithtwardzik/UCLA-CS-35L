Lab 9 Log

1) I used the command:
ssh-keygen
Then, I pressed enter, and it saved the key to: /u/eng/class/classtwa/.ssh/id_rsa
After this, I entered a passphrase: (I won't put it here for security reasons)
It ouputted the following:

Your identification has been saved in /u/eng/class/classtwa/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /u/eng/class/classtwa/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:gvykyRdFvwrD62V3CimdLc6gMfyIfRcb71tKRE9bGIY classtwa@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|        .  .o    |
|       . .E. o   |
|        . o o .  |
|   . o . . + o   |
|    o B S o o    |
|   o = Bo*       |
|    B * X=+ o    |
|   o O.Bo=.=     |
|  . +.o.o.=.     |
+----[SHA256]-----+

I then ran the following commands and it gave the following output:
ssh-keygen -l
Enter file in which the key is (/u/eng/class/classtwa/.ssh/id_rsa):
2048 SHA256:gvykyRdFvwrD62V3CimdLc6gMfyIfRcb71tKRE9bGIY classtwa@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu

I copied over the contents of .ssh/id_rsa.pub to the file .ssh/authorized_keys.

Then I used the following commands:
ssh-copy-id classtwa@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu
This gave the output:
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/u/eng/class/classtwa/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
classtwa@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu's password:

I inputted my password here. Then it outputted:

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'classtwa@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

After this, I ran the following command and it outputted:
ssh classtwa@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu
Enter passphrase for key '/u/eng/class/classtwa/.ssh/id_rsa':
 
However, it wanted a passphrase. So then, I used the commands:
eval $(ssh-agent)

This outputted:
Agent pid 30314

I ran:
ssh-add

It outputted:
Enter passphrase for /u/eng/class/classtwa/.ssh/id_rsa:
Identity added: /u/eng/class/classtwa/.ssh/id_rsa (/u/eng/class/classtwa/.ssh/id_rsa)

Finally, when I ssh'ed, using the below command, it did not prompt for a login
or password or passphrase:
ssh classtwa@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu

2) On XQuartz, I used the command:
ssh -X classtwa@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu

Then, I logged in, and ran the command 'xeyes', which outputted a graphical
display of the roaming eyes. 

3) I opened up the config file:
emacs ~/.ssh/config

Then, I editted it as follows:
Host lnxsrv
     HostName lnxsrv08.seas.ucla.edu
     User classtwa

Host seven
     ProxyCommand ssh -q lnxsrv nc lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu 22

And finally I ran it by ssh'ing into the nicknamed 'lnxsrv':
ssh lnxsrv

This prompted me for the passphrase I set up, and connected me to lnxsrv08.

Then, I tried the multihop, by ssh'ing into the nicknamed 'seven':
ssh seven

This worked, hopping from a connection to lnxsrv08 to a connection to
lnxsrv07. 

Previously, when I ssh'ed into other servers, using:
ssh lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu
This did require a password.

However, with the -A option because of the authentication agent forwarding,
no password was necessary.
