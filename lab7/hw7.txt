Homework 7 Log

1) I created and entered this file: 
touch hw7.txt
emacs hw7.txt

2) I used the following to checkout a new branch named 'quote':
git checkout -b quote v3.0

3) I used the following patch command to apply quote-patch-3.0.txt:
patch -p1 < ~/Desktop/35L/lab7/quote-3.0-patch.txt

4) Basically, C-x 4 a opens up a ChangeLog for you to edit, giving you the 
basic format of a ChangeLog unto which you can add entries.

5) I opened up emacs using: 
emacs quote-3.0-patch.txt

Then, I used the command:
C-x 4 a 

This opened up a ChangeLog, and I crafted ChangeLog entries for each of the 
files that are patched using quote-3.0-patch.txt, using the patching list to 
get a list of all the file names:

patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

ChangeLog entry: 

2020-02-24  Faith Sara Twardzik  <classtwa@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>

        * src/cmp.c: convert ` (grave) to ' (apostrophe) in character strings
        * src/diff.c: convert ` (grave) to ' (apostrophe) in character strings
        * src/diff3.c: convert ` (grave) to ' (apostrophe) in character strings
        * src/dir.c: convert ` (grave) to ' (apostrophe) in character strings
        * src/sdiff.c: convert ` (grave) to ' (apostrophe) in character strings

6) Then, I used git add to move all of the files modified by the patch to
the staging area to be committed:
git add --all

Finally, I used git commit to commit all of these modified files:
git commit

And I copied and pasted the ChangeLog entry into the commit message, using
:wq to exit the text editor when I was finished.

I realized later on that I could have also used:
git commit -F ~/Desktop/35L/lab7/ChangeLog

This would have made the ChangeLog text from this file the commit message.

7) I used the following command to generate a patch:
git format-patch -1 --stdout > ~/Desktop/35L/lab7/formatted-patch.txt

8) I cloned a new repository and called it diffutils_check:
git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git diffutils_check

Then, I moved into diffutils_check and checked out a new branch at v3.0:
git checkout -b patchery v3.0

Then I used the following command to apply the patch in the diffutils_check
directory:
git am ~/Desktop/35L/lab7/formatted-patch.txt

Then, I went on to build as we did before:
./bootstrap
patch -p0 < ~/Desktop/35L/lab7/diffutils-gets.diff
./configure
make
make check

These all worked, except for the same errors with make check as before:
/bin/sh: /bin/sh: cannot execute binary file
make[3]: *** [basic.log] Error 126
make[3]: Leaving directory `/w/home.27/class/classtwa/Desktop/35L/lab7/
diffutils_check/diffutils/tests'
make[2]: *** [check-TESTS] Error 2
make[2]: Leaving directory `/w/home.27/class/classtwa/Desktop/35L/lab7/
diffutils_check/diffutils/tests'
make[1]: *** [check-am] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/w/home.27/class/classtwa/Desktop/35L/lab7/
diffutils_check/diffutils/tests'
make: *** [check-recursive] Error 1

9) I ran the following command in the diffutils directory:
make distdir

This created a directory called: diffutils-3.0.1-f585
I moved into this directory and used emacs to look at the file ChangeLog. This 
version of the ChangeLog looked exactly as it should.
 
10) I used XQuartz.    

The newest merge that is not newer than 01-25-2015 is: 
"Merge branch 'master' into xwidget", made on 2015-01-25 12:19:27, 
authored and committed by Joakim Verona <joakim@verona.se>.
I found this by scrolling through to find the correct date.

The subwindows are: 
The top left side has the commit message.
The middle has the author/committer.
The right side has the date of the commit.
The bottom left subwindow has all of the additional information, including author, 
committer,parents, children, etc.

To check yourself, you can go to the directory ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L and run:
git log --before="2015-01-26" --after="2015-01-24" --pretty="%s %cd" --merges

This will show the merge that occurred on 01-25-2015, and will give both the date 
and description.
