1. Keystrokes used to discover the answer: man man RET q man -k to
Answer: The shell command -- man -k keyword -- where keyword is a specific word you're searching for in man page description sections, will print out all the commands with that keyword.

2. The shell commands mv and sh are located in /usr/bin (I used: find /usr -name mv and then find /usr -name sh in order to find the location of both executables). They were also listed as being located in different directories, such as mv also being in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/mv, but /usr/bin was the first listing.
 
3. The ar executable creates, modifies, and extracts from archives, which is a file containing a structure of files where the original files can be accessed. The pr executable converts text files for printing, and has many options for formatting. The tr executable translates, squeezes, or deletes characters from standard input, and writes to standard output. 
Shell commands used: find /usr/bin -name *r and then I combed through the output of files/directories ending in the letter 'r' for the desired executables.

4. I used: ls -l /usr/bin/emacs to get the long form of the emacs executable, including the symbolic link and link target. The file that is being executed is: /etc/alternatives/emacs, which is a symbolic link to: /usr/bin/emacs-24.3 (I found this using the shell command ls -l /etc/alternatives/emacs). This is not a link, so it is the actual file that is being executed.
   
5. The version of the /usr/bin/gcc is: 4.8.5 20150623 (I used /usr/bin/gcc --version to get this info). The version of plain gcc is: 9.2.0. I got this by first using the command: export PATH="/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH". Since before I used that command, I was getting the same version info for both gcc's, which means it was reading the /usr/bin/gcc for both, because the path included /usr/bin. When this /usr/local/cs/bin is exported from the current $PATH, however, the "plain" gcc no longer also refers to /usr/bin/gcc, so it has a different version because it is not the same gcc. The inodes are also different, indicating they are different programs.
 
6. u+sx means to change the file's permissions so that both: execute or search for directories (x) and set user or group ID on execution (s) are added to the user's permissions (u), which are the first set of letters in the permissions set. o-w means to change the file's permissions so that writing (w) is removed from the permissions/ability of other users not in the file group (o).

7. I used: find /usr/local/cs -mtime -28 -type d >new.txt (this redirected the output directories to the file new.txt, which had 101 lines, signalling that there are 101 directories modified in the last four weeks in /usr/local/cs, which are listed below because some TA's said that we needed to list them as well):

8. We can find the executable file "find" by running: find /usr -name find which gives us /usr/bin/find, so find is in /usr/bin. After this, I used: find /usr/bin -type l >new.txt (this redirected into new.txt all of the files/directories in /usr/bin that are symbolic links, and since new.txt has 280 lines, there are 280 that are symbolic links, which are listed below because some of the TA's said to list them all). You could also use the command: find /usr/bin -type l | wc -l which returns the word count 280.

9. I used the command: ls -l -t /usr/lib64 
This gives the oldest modified files at the bottom, with the most recently-modified files at the top. The oldest modified file ended up being: librom1394.so.0.3.0 which was last modified on December 28th, 2013. 

10. The locale definition files, where locale gets its data from, are within: /usr/share/i18n/locales. I found this using the commands: man locale (and in the manual page I found that path to the definition files), and then I used ls /usr/share/i18n/locales to examine the data files inside, and to make sure this is actually where locale's data files are stored. When I ran locale, it printed out the current environment variables for the directory/position I was at, which is the "data" being referenced. 

11. I opened up emacs, using the keystrokes: e m a c s and then I used the keystrokes/commands: C-h a d o w n c a s e to search for commands with "downcase" in their title. The two that I found were: downcase-region (which converts the region to lower-case), and downcase-word (which converts the following word to lower-case).

12.
I used the C-h c commands to search for the names of each of the keystrokes, and if I didn't already know them (I knew most of them), I used C-h a (followed by the name of the command) to see a detailed description of their function.

C-M-r
Description: isearch-backward-regexp is similar to C-r (isearch-backward) but it searchs backwards incrementally for regular expressions, instead of keywords (a regular expression is something like [^[:ascii:]] from the hw portion. Just a search pattern)

C-M-s
Description: isearch-forward-regexp is similar to C-s (isearch-forward) except it searches forwards incrementally in the buffer, for regular expressions instead of keywords

C-M-t
Description: transpose-sexps switches the current sexp that your cursor is on, with the most previous sexp before that one, where a sexp is just a balanced expression.

C-M-u
Description: backward-up-list moves over lists and sexps, moving backward across the sexp until it comes across the forward-facing delimiter at the beginning of the sexp (parentheses, bracket, etc). Basically, used anywhere in the sexp, it brings the cursor back to the first, forward-facing delimiter, (parentheses). It moves backward out one level of parentheses. 

C-M-v
Description: scroll-other-window scrolls downwards on the next emacs window you have open, instead of the one you are currently editing (you can input arguments to scroll a certain amount).
 
13. I used the C-h c command, followed by C-g to get more info. C-g runs the command keyboard-quit, which erases a command that you're currently writing but haven't executed yet. If you've written C-M-, for example, C-g erases this so the line is clean for the next command. It also quits commands that are currently running, but haven't finished running, such as kills, and does so in a way so that not a fraction of the command is executed (it executes the whole thing or returns to the original state). C-g isn't actually a command that quits itself; it sets a quit-flag that Lisp uses to quit, or signals a quit condition, as 'C-h a quit' tells us.
 
14. In essence, the yank function yanks back a killed portion of text off of the kill ring, and pastes it into the buffer. Any kill command that you use, such as C-k to kill a line, adds the killed portion of text onto the kill ring. Then, if you invoke the keystrokes C-y afterwards, this yanks back the most recently killed text and pastes it into the buffer. If you want to paste in a killed piece of text that is less recent, you can use the keystroke M-y to cycle through the kill ring, where it will populate the buffer with each kill on the kill ring, until you stop cycling with M-y when you've found what you want to yank back. Another thing about yanking is that if you kill in one buffer, you can yank in another, since kill rings are global.

15. 
Using emacs, I used the commands: C-x d /usr/bin RET
On the command line, I used: ls -l /usr/bin >new.txt
First, I opened up new.txt next to the emacs dired listing and scrolled to the top. Right away, you can see that the difference is that the command line: ls -l command does not show hidden files, whereas the dired directory listing does show these hidden files/directories. For example, at the top of the emacs list are . and .. which are the current and parent directories. However, the listing from ls -l does not show these. If we used the command: ls -l -a we would be able to see these hidden files/directories, but we can't just from ls -l. 

I also noticed that the command output had different colorings for the files, based on permissions, whereas the files in emacs were all in the same color. For example, files with execution permission were colored green, whereas ones without the (x) execution permission were colored gray in the output here. Whereas, there was no coloring based on permissions in the dired list.
